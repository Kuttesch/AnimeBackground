## Why?

I created this project to practice my Python skills and to learn how to interact with APIs. I found the [Waifu API](https://waifu.pics/docs) with my girlfriend and thought it would be a fun project to create a script that sets your desktop background to a random image from the API.
Through this project, I practiced working with APIs, JSON data, and setting desktop backgrounds with Python.

## Installation

To install Waifu Background Setter, you need to clone the repository and install the necessary Python libraries.

```bash
cd YourDownloadDirection
git clone https://github.com/Kuttesch/AnimeBackground.git
cd WaifuBackgroundSetter
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the script by simply typing `python background.py` in your terminal with the desired arguments.

```bash
python background.py -SFW_WAIFU
```

This will set your desktop background to a random SFW (Safe For Work) image from the "WAIFU" category.
